# Personal Site HTML Only
This code represents the HTML code for a sample personal website belonging to me, a Junior Software Developer with a focus on Python. 
## Content  
The website provides some information about my education, work experience, skills, and hobbies.  
It is built using HTML and includes a brief introduction about me, including my educational background and how I came to be interested in programming. Additionally, it provides a list of my educational courses and my work experience, as well as a table detailing my skillset.  
The website also includes __links__ to hobbies and a contact page for those interested in reaching out, exemplifying the use of anchor tags. 
## Note
However, this is not my full resume, the HTML code serving as a solid foundation for a future more professional personal website, with clear and concise information presented in an organized manner.
